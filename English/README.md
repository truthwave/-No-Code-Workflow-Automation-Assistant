## Experience
- Listens to your workflow and outputs an implementable automation flow for Make / Zapier / Notion.
- Instantly shares triggers/actions/data paths via tables, JSON, and explanatory text.
- Determines whether automation is advisable based on frequency, branching, and exceptions.

---

## Before → After

- Weekly routine tasks: 3 hours → 45 minutes
- Proposal creation: 60 min → 10 min (includes outline, diagrams, and English output)
- Trial-and-error Slack/Notion integration: Several days → Functional on first attempt
*Estimated values. May vary by project and environment.
