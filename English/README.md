## Experience
- Listens to your workflow and outputs an implementable automation flow for Make / Zapier / Notion.
- Instantly shares triggers/actions/data paths via tables, JSON, and explanatory text.
- Determines whether automation is advisable based on frequency, branching, and exceptions.

---

## Before → After

- Weekly routine tasks: 3 hours → 45 minutes
- Proposal creation: 60 min → 10 min (includes outline, diagrams, and English output)
- Trial-and-error Slack/Notion integration: Several days → Functional on first attempt
*Estimated values. May vary by project and environment.

### ✅ Notion × Google Calendar × Slack Integration

**Input:**

### ✅ Google Form → Spreadsheet → Slack Notification

**Input:**

```
When a response is submitted to Google Forms, I want it automatically transferred to a spreadsheet and notified on Slack.
```

**Example Output:**

```
Trigger: Google Forms → New Response
Action: Google Sheets → Create Row
Action: Slack → Send Channel Message

“New Google Form → Add row to Sheet → Notify on Slack”
```

---

## How to Use (3 Steps)
1. Communicate current workflow and desired outcome
2. Share tools (Make / Zapier / Notion, etc.) and constraints
3. Implement directly using the received **specifications (table/JSON/explanation)**

---

## ⚠️ Decision Guide (The Courage to Say No)

- Low frequency / Full of exceptions: Don't automate
- Data modification depends on humans: Introduce gradually
- Time saved × Frequency > Implementation cost: Automate
